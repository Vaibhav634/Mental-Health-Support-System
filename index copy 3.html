                        Psychodynamic therapy is a talking therapy. This means that it is based on the concept that talking about problems can help people learn and develop the skills they need to address them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is an approach that embraces the multifaceted aspects of an individualâ€™s life. It strives to help people understand the sometimes unknown or unconscious motivations behind difficult feelings and behaviors.

                Psychodynamic therapy is rooted in psychoanalytic theory but is often a less intensive and lengthy process than traditional psychoanalysis. While psychoanalysis tends to focus a great deal on the patient and therapist relationship, psychodynamic therapy also places a great deal of emphasis on a patientâ€™s relationships with other people in the outside world.

                <b><li>Dynamic interpersonal therapy (DIT)</b> Dynamic interpersonal therapy is a specialized form of therapy that was originally designed specifically to treat mood disorders. During a 16-session program, youâ€™ll focus on how specific patterns in your relationship can result in negative outcomes..</li><br/>
             
                    <b><li>Brief psychodynamic therapy</b> Brief psychodynamic therapy offers frequent, typically 1 to 2 times a week, sessions with a therapist over the course of several months..</li><br/>
                   
                    <b><li>Long-term psychodynamic therapy</b> Long-term psychodynamic therapy is conducted over the course of at least 2 years. Itâ€™s been found effective in treating several mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 

                        Additionally, some promising research has shown that long-term psychodynamic therapy can be effective in treating depression when other types of treatment havenâ€™t helped.</li><br/>
                   
                    <b><li>Psychodynamic family therapy</b> Psychodynamic family therapy is often a long-term process that might be effective when there are consistent, chronic problems or issues in a family.

                    <b><li>Psychodynamic art or music therapy:</b> Art and music therapy are more nontraditional forms of psychodynamic therapy that use the creativity of art and music to help you express your feelings, thoughts, and emotions.
