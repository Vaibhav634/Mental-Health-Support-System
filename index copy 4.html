                        Mentalization-based therapy is an evidence-based treatment for people with borderline personality disorder and other mental health conditions that draws from several different psychotherapeutic approaches. Mentalization-based treatment was developed in the 1990s by Anthony Bateman and Peter Fonagy specifically for people with borderline personalities.

                Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is a type of long-term psychotherapy. Mentalisation is the ability to think about thinking. It helps to make sense of our thoughts, beliefs, wishes and feelings and to link these to our actions and behaviours.Mentalisation is a normal capacity that we all use in everyday life. It underpins all human relationships. However, some people find it more difficult to mentalise in certain situations than others.

                <b><h3>5 Mentalization-Based Techniques</h3></b>
                <br/>
         
                <ol>
                <b><li>Support & empathy : </b> Empathetic statements strengthen rapport and the therapeutic relationship, which is an essential foundation of MBT (Bateman & Fonagy, 2006).

                    The therapist must be able to provide support, give the client autonomy, and judiciously praise them in order to elicit change. Empathy and support are critical to any form of therapy but are particularly important in MBT. Empathy and support create new, healthy bonds between client and therapist, which is essential to the attachment theory that MBT is grounded in.</li><br/>
             
                    <b><li>Clarification : </b> In MBT, the therapist needs to clarify and elaborate to get a detailed picture of behavioral sequences and associated feelings. This clarification helps the client make connections between actions and feelings (Bateman & Fonagy, 2006).

                        Clarification includes repeating statements back to the client and asking questions the client can answer clearly.</li><br/>
                   
                    <b><li> Exploration : </b>With exploration, the client can develop a curiosity of thoughts, feelings, and motivations (Bateman & Fonagy, 2006).
                        This is also a technique that helps the client share the therapistâ€™s perspective and consider alternative experiences of the same event. Exploration provides an opportunity for the client to work on interpersonal relationship skills.</li><br/>

                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                   
                    <b><li>Challenging : </b>Challenging the client is a technique of exploring their underlying emotional state by confronting their perspective (Bateman & Fonagy, 2006). This technique is a balance of pushing the client into conflict and finding acceptance with alternate beliefs.</li><br/>
                
                    <b><li>Transference : </b> Transference is often used in MBT to direct the patientâ€™s emotions toward the therapist in order to analyze them (Allen et al., 2003).

                        While transference has often been seen as a negative in therapy, it can have numerous benefits when used intentionally. It helps patients think before they react to their own feelings and the perceived feelings of others.. 

                        Art and music therapy tend to be particularly effective for people who are shy or who find it difficult to talk or express themselves..</li><br/>

             <b><h3>Is it Effective?</h3></b>
             <br/>
             <p>Measuring the impact of treatment for psychological issues can be complicated. That said, there is evidenceTrusted Source to suggest that psychodynamic therapy works for the following conditions:</p>
<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

    <li><b>Depression:</b> Studies indicate that it can help people address recurring life patterns that play a part in their depression.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Social anxiety, social phobia, and panic disorder:</b> Studies have found promising results and improved remission.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Anorexia nervosa:</b> Strong evidence suggests that it promotes recovery from anorexia nervosa.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Pain:</b> Unexplained chronic and abdominal pain respond well to this therapy, data suggest.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Borderline personality disorder:</b> Studies have found structured, integrated, and supervised treatment to be effective.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b></b>Psychopathological issues in children and adolescents:</b> Researchers have found psychodynamic treatment to be effective overall in reducing symptoms of psychopathological issues in children aged 6â€“18 years.</li>
